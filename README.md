# TweetWithGUI
 Script that downloads media from twitter.

CURRENTLY Must run using a python IDE.

The packages to download videos and GIF's are too large to compress into a .exe at the moment.  I am working on a fix.

Use "BROWSE" to select a folder to download the media into.
INPUT: Twitter link that has some media(image, video, GIF)
OUTPUT: File is downloaded at highest possible quality into the selected folder and titled under the ID of the tweet.
